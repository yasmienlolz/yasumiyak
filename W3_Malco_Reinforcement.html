<font face="georgia" size="3" color="white"><b>When</b> I was in grade 7 it was pandemic. I had a hard time focusing on my studies because we used google classroom and google meet, but as the time had passed i eventually got used to online class and passed grade 7.</font><br>
<font face="georgia" size="3" color="white"><u><i>In</u></i>
grade 8 i focused on my studies because i was determined to stay in ste and to be an honor student so i worked really hard and put a lot of effort on my outputs.</font><br>
<font face="georgia" size="3" color="white">Grade 8 has already passed and im in grade 9 now. First face to face classes after 2 years. At first i didn't know how to act around my classmates because i haven't met them before and i didn't know how to approach them. 2nd week of face to face classes i already gained friends and i was happy about it. Grade 9 is really hard but im trying my best to stay in ste because it has a lot of good opportunities that can help me in the future.
