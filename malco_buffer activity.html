<p><b><font face = "verdana">New York CNN Business</b> -Elon Musk on Monday claimed that apple has "threatened" to pull Twitter from its IOS app store, a move that could be devastating to the company Musk just acquited for $44 billion</p>
<p><i><font face = "verdana">Apple <u>(AAPL)</u> has also threatened to withhold Twitter from its app store, but won't tell us why",</i> Musk said in one of several tweets Monday taking aim at Apple <u>(AAPL)</u> and its CEO for alleged moves that could undermine Twitter's business.
<p><font face = "verdana">In another tweet, Musk claimed that Apple has mostly stopped advertising on twitter. <i>"Do they hate free speech in America,"</i>he said, in an apparent reference to his oft-stated desire to bolster his idea  of free speech on the platform. <i> "What's going on here [Apple CEO Tim Cook]?"</i> Musk added in a follow-up tweet. He also <u>criticized</u> Apple's size, <u>claimed</u> it engages in "censorship", and <u>called out</u> the 30% transaction fee Apple charges large app developers to be listed in its app store.</p>
<p><font face = "verdana">In one tweet Monday, Musk asked his nearly 120 million follower if they know <i> "Apple puts a secret 30% tax on everything you buy through their App Store? "</i> In aother tweet, he posted a picture of a highway exit: one lane headed toward <i>"pay 30%",</i> the other pointed toward " go to war". An old  car labeled "Elon" skidded toward the latter.
