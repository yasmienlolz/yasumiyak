<i>When it comes to decision making, I constantly look for more ways or
 ideas to take into consideration; 
I rarely consider "pwede na yan" or "okay na to" responses because I believe that there is 
always more that can be done to make anything perfect. So, let's say I ran into a problem and was seriously affected by it. I would take some time to relax and clear my head before coming back, but stronger than before. These past few years have taught me that being vulnerable is acceptable as long as you can get yourself together and continue on your path.
